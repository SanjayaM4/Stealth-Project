*NPC's react to distractions such as gunshots and will investigate, if suspicious they shoot on sight.*

## Future Plans

While this project is currently quite simple, I am actively working on enhancing it and adding new features. Some plans for improvement are:

- Create more levels that are complex and puzzle-like for the player.
- Add functionality to reposition bodies of slain enemies.
- Create/source assets to make the characters and environment aesthetically pleasing.
- Implement a story mode with clear narrative.

Thank you for checking out my WIP!
